    <p>  <br>Buy This Land at  Amazon  or  Penguin-Random House . From the folks at Viking-Penguin: A hard-hitting look at the battle now raging over the fate of the public lands in the American West-and a plea for the protection of these last wild places The public lands of the western United States comprise some 450 million acres of grassland, steppe land, canyons, forests, and mountains. It's an American commons, and it is under assault as never before. Journalist Christopher Ketcham has been documenting the confluence of commercial exploitation and governmental misconduct in this region for over a decade. His revelatory book takes the reader on a journey across these last wild places, to see how capitalism is killing our great commons. Ketcham begins in Utah, revealing the environmental destruction caused by unregulated public lands livestock grazing, and exposing rampant malfeasance in the federal land management agencies, who have been compromised by the profit-driven livestock and energy interests they are supposed to regulate. He then turns to the broad effects of those corrupt politics on wildlife. He tracks the Department of Interior's failure to implement and enforce the Endangered Species Act-including its stark betrayal of protections for the grizzly bear and the sage grouse-and investigates the destructive behavior of U.S. Wildlife Services in their shocking mass slaughter of animals that threaten the livestock industry. Along the way, Ketcham talks with ecologists, biologists, botanists, former government employees, whistleblowers, grassroots environmentalists and other citizens who are fighting to protect the public domain for future generations. This Land  is a colorful muckraking journey-part Edward Abbey, part Upton Sinclair-exposing the rot in American politics that is rapidly leading to the sell-out of our national heritage. The book ends with Ketcham's vision of ecological restoration for the American West: freeing the trampled, denuded ecosystems from the effects of grazing, enforcing the laws already in place to defend biodiversity, allowing the native species of the West to recover under a fully implemented Endangered Species Act, and establishing vast stretches of public land where there will be no development at all, not even for recreation.  </p>  <p>   <br>This Land book cover by Christopher Ketcham</p>  <p> Reviews of This Land  <br>   <br> Kirkus Reviews:  "Angry, eloquent, and urgent-required reading for anyone who cares about the Earth." LA Times:  "The American West is dying. Christopher Ketcham's 'This Land' is a rallying cry to save it" NY Times:  "Can the American West be saved?" NY Times Book Review podcast:  "The Ruining of the American West" Outside Magazine:  "This Land is the 'Desert Solitaire' of our time"  Chicago Review of Books:  "Politics of the Public Domain" The New Yorker,  in Briefly Noted San Francisco Chronicle:  "A pair of books suggests we're saving the salmon, but losing the West" The American Scholar:  "Bonanza of Greed: Myths and lies will, if we let them, spell the end of the public domain" The Intercept:  "Hikers, Trump, and the Capitalist Conspiracy to Ruin Public Lands"  Adventure Journal:  "'This Land' Documents the Ruining of the American West-And Offers Solutions to Fix It" National Parks Traveler:  "The story Ketcham tells is actually getting much worse, and America's public estate is at greater risk than ever. Widespread reading and discussion of Ketcham's exposé is much needed." New York Journal of Books:  "This book should be required reading for all high school students, elected officials, and environmental advocacy groups." Publishers Weekly:  a "passionate, sometimes vitriolic environmentalist jeremiad" Open Letters Review, Best Books of 2019: " If there's any justice in the reading world, Christopher Ketcham's book on the full-blown assault being conducted by the US government on US public wild lands will become every bit as much of a pivotal environmental classic as Rachel Carson's  Silent Spring ." ** Praise for  This Land : "As Christopher Ketcham says so eloquently in these pages, the vast public lands are perhaps America's greatest legacy, a landscape of the scale necessary to help preserve the diversity of life on a hot planet in a tough century. That's why we need to pay such attention to the stories he tells of the threats they face."  -Bill McKibben, author of Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out? "Ferocious . . . [a] stunning book . . . What makes  This Land  so pressing and so painful is that it drains any reservoirs of political naïveté you may have left. It reminds us that myths . . . are the collective lies we tell ourselves to keep from seeing what is actually happening . . .  This Land  is a book that will help us tell the story truthfully, a book for the hard times now that are a prelude to harder times ahead."  -Verlyn Klinkenborg, author of  Making Hay  and former editorial board member of the  New York Times "Christopher Ketcham is a marvelously fresh and forceful voice, one unaffected by the squishy language and languid resistance of our grotesquely compromised (and well-funded) environmental organizations. Instructive and swiftly, smartly written, this book about the pillage and poisoning of our public lands reinvigorates writing as a force for outrage and change at the same time as it returns us to the clear-headed, big-hearted zeal of classic environmental works."  -Joy Williams, author of  The Florida Keys "As potent in its way as  Silent Spring . This book will open your eyes to the greed and abuse destroying our public lands. Better yet, it will make you angry."  -T. C. Boyle, author of  Outside Looking In "[A]n impressive book debut . . . Echoing writers such as Bernard DeVoto, Edward Abbey, and Aldo Leopold, Ketcham underscores the crucial importance of diverse, wild ecosystems and urges 'a campaign for public lands that is vital, fierce, impassioned, occasionally dangerous, without hypocrisy, that stands against the tyranny of money.' Angry, eloquent, and urgent-required reading for anyone who cares about the Earth."  - Kirkus  (starred review)  "Powerful . . . passionate . . . Ketcham's roster of villains is long . . . he balances vehemence with sharp-eyed reportage, fascinating explanations of ecological intricacies, and rapturous evocations of wild places."  - Publishers Weekly  "At a time when our politics couldn't be more superficial, shallow, and ephemeral, here is a war cry for the profound, deep, and long lasting. In this country, our public lands have always defined us, and the original vision for those lands was revolutionary. With  This Land , Christopher Ketcham helps us see that vision anew, and offers us an equally revolutionary picture of our public lands as large, connected, healthy, cow-less, car-less (and sometimes people-less), and as perhaps our last hope in a warming world steeped in the politics of despair. In the thoughtful but rowdy tradition of Bernard DeVoto and Edward Abbey, with a dash of John Wesley Powell and Wallace Stegner thrown in, Ketcham reminds us that while the way we have treated our public lands has been criminal, we can find salvation, for them and for ourselves, in their restoration. I would challenge anyone to read this inspiring book and not be stirred to fight for this land."  -David Gessner, author of  All the Wild That Remains: Edward Abbey, Wallace Stegner and the American West "Brutally honest accounts about politicians are rarely welcomed by their subjects. Christopher Ketcham's book about contemporary conflicts over public lands in the western United States is such a book. If I were an official of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or if I were associated with the livestock industry in the West, I'm sure that I would pay many hundreds of thousands of dollars to have it suppressed."  -Michael Soulé, professor emeritus of environmental studies, University of California, Santa Cruz " This Land  is the book we've all been waiting for. It is simultaneously profound and incisive, breathtaking and heartbreaking, inspiring and sobering. Most of all it is imbued with a love of the land: the land we all love, the land we need, the land that needs us now more than ever. This book is desperately and wildly important."  -Derrick Jensen, author of  The Myth of Human Supremacy "This may be the most important book about the American West since Edward Abbey's Desert Solitaire and, like Abbey before him, Ketcham refuses to go down without a fight.  This Land  is a Code Red alert for what's left of the West, an urgent howl to join him on the frontlines of the only war that really matters: the war against life on Earth. Nearly every page burns with a ferocious rage at the mutilation of the landscape that shaped the American character."  -Jeffrey St. Clair, editor-in-chief of  CounterPunch "America's patchwork system of public lands-nearly all in the West-is a socialist anomaly in the heart of the capitalist beast, and one of the wonders of the world. But those lands and their irreplaceable animal and plant life face unrelenting threat from the forces of rapine and pillage. Christopher Ketcham lays bare those many threats in pissed-off, funny, loving, deeply informed prose. He calls for nothing more or less than a people's war in defense of what remains, and he makes a superb case for the fight."  -Jeff Nichols, author of  Prostitution, Polygamy, and Power: Salt Lake City, 1847-1918 From the folks at Viking-Penguin: A hard-hitting look at the battle now raging over the fate of the public lands in the American West-and a plea for the protection of these last wild places The public lands of the western United States comprise some 450 million acres of grassland, steppe land, canyons, forests, and mountains.

His revelatory book takes the reader on a journey across these last wild places, to see how capitalism is killing our great commons. Ketcham begins in Utah, revealing the environmental destruction caused by unregulated public lands livestock grazing, and exposing rampant malfeasance in the federal land management agencies, who have been compromised by the profit-driven livestock and energy interests they are supposed to regulate. He then turns to the broad effects of those corrupt politics on wildlife. He tracks the Department of Interior's failure to implement and enforce the Endangered Species Act-including its stark betrayal of protections for the grizzly bear and the sage grouse-and investigates the destructive behavior of U.S. Wildlife Services in their shocking mass slaughter of animals that threaten the livestock industry. Along the way, Ketcham talks with ecologists, biologists, botanists, former government employees, whistleblowers, grassroots environmentalists and other citizens who are fighting to protect the public domain for future generations.</p><p><em>This Land </em>is a colorful muckraking journey-part Edward Abbey, part Upton Sinclair-exposing the rot in American politics that is rapidly leading to the sell-out of our national heritage. The book ends with Ketcham's vision of ecological restoration for the American West: freeing the trampled, denuded ecosystems from the effects of grazing, enforcing the laws already in place to defend biodiversity, allowing the native species of the West to recover under a fully implemented Endangered Species Act, and establishing vast stretches of public land where there will be no development at all, not even for recreation.  </p>
