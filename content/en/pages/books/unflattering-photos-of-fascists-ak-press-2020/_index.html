    Unflattering Photos of Fascists (AK Press, 2020)

    <p>  <br>From the AK Press promotional copy: Christopher Ketcham introduces us to a nightmare landscape that is peculiarly American. Alt Righters. Neo-nazis. Boogaloo Bois. White nationalists. Western chauvinists. These creatures roam the streets, often indistinguishable from their wider kin, the Trumpenvolk. These motley groups come together occasionally to threaten, bully, and assault others, seeking "safe space" for their hate. They are pathetic. And our photos show it. Jeff Schwilk has been fighting hate in the Pacific Northwest for decades, most recently by capturing these goons as they terrorize the people of Portland, Oregon, and beyond. The essays and images in these pages expose these soldiers of intolerance, while reminding the rest of us that love, solidarity, and mutual aid are the weapons that will defeat them. The material in this book powerfully reminds us that communities of compassion must work vigilantly to unite against intimidation and hate. Over thirty of Schwilk's color photos are accompanied by essays contextualizing the subject matter. Together, they investigate the rise of American fascism and authoritarianism in our current era. They also measure the shrinking distance between full-blown fascists and regular, rage-fueled white Americans animated by a petty, imagined victimhood. The contributors shine a light on these bigots, who crawled out from under their rocks lured by the dog whistles of racist politicians and Alt Right provocateurs-the better to send them back into the darkness where they belong.   </p>
